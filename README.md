# bioenergy_crop_models
This repository hosts the code required for an interactive web app allowing for BETO BRIDGES Case Study exploration of data related to the Case Study: Bioenergy &amp; the Environment: Can Bioenergy Crops Improve Water Quality? 

# directions
This interactive app is intended for users of the BETO BRIDGES Case Study in order to simplify the data analysis of watershed model data.  
Users can select whether to compare results for nitrate leaching or sediment.  Values shown are for the individual watersheds delineated by the SWAT model as described in the case study materials.  Users can also select which bioenergy crop to view results for.  This is intended to help with completing Table 6, which requires identification of watersheds for bioenergy crop implementation.  Which ones provide the greatest benefit in terms of reduced nitrate leaching and/or sedimentation?
