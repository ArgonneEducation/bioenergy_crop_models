# Bioenergy_crop_models
This interactive is intended for use with a case study developed by DOE's Alternative Fuels and Feedstocks Office as part of the Bioenergy Research and Education Bridge Program (BRIDGES).

BRIDGES is a bioenergy case study-based educational toolkit created in partnership with Argonne National Laboratory and Idaho National Laboratory, as well as education, community, industry, and other government partners. You can learn more about the program at https://www.energy.gov/eere/bioenergy/bioenergy-research-and-education-bridge-program .

## Source_and_Funding
The data presented here are from a manuscript created by UChicago Argonne, LLC, Operator of Argonne National Laboratory. Argonne, a US Department of Energy Office of Science laboratory, is operated under Contract No. DE-AC02-06CH11357.  The specific publication referenced is Herbert Ssegane and M. Cristina Negri. 2016. “An Integrated Landscape Designed for Commodity and Bioenergy Crops for a Tile-Drained Agricultural Watershed.” Journal of Environmental Quality 45 (5): 1588–1596. doi.org/10.2134/jeq2015.10.0518.  

## Using_the_App
This interactive app is intended for users of the BETO BRIDGES Case Study in order to simplify the data analysis of watershed model data.  
Users can select whether to compare results for nitrate leaching or sediment.  By default, values for nitrate leaching are shown.  Values shown are for the individual watersheds delineated by the SWAT model as described in the case study materials.  Users can also select which bioenergy crop (Switchgrass, Shrub Willow, or Big Bluestem) to view results for and compare to the Business As Usual model.  This is intended to aid students with completing Table 6, which requires identification of watersheds for bioenergy crop implementation.  Which watersheds show the greatest benefit in terms of reduced nitrate leaching and/or sedimentation from implementation of bioenergy cropping in marginal areas?

## Background_Information
The study referenced here involves the idea of careful placement of bioenergy crops in subproductive agricultural areas to provide positive water quality benefits.  The study used the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to forecast the impact of bioenergy crops in subfield areas on annual grain yields, as well as nitrate and sediment exports.  It showed no significant impact on grain production and reduced nitrate and sediment exports, while producing significant biomass for bioenergy production.  Researchers used the soil survey geographic database (SSURGO) from USDA-NRCS, 2012 for soil data.  Drainage classes were determined in part using the 2012 National Agricultural Statistics Service data (USDA-NASS, 2012).  Watersheds were delineated using ArcSWAT (version 2012.10.16). Crop rotations were generated from 2010 to 2012 NASS data.  More detail can be found in the referenced published paper.

## Glossary

### Business As Usual 
This refers to a baseline model using current land use and management operations from 2011 to 2013 with no bioenergy cropping in marginal areas.

### Big Bluestem 
A native perennial prairie grass with potential for bioenergy production. 
Andropogon gerardi 

### Nitrate Leaching 
Nitrates are prevalent in agricultural fertilizer used for traditional production and are also prevalent in runoff from agricultural lands.  Elevated nitrate levels in surface waters can lead to increased plant growth in these waters, which can have negative effects on other parts of the ecosystem.  In addition, increased nitrate concentrations in drinking water present hazards to human health.  The use of bioenergy crops in particular areas of an agricultural landscape can help to reduce the amount of nitrates that end up in surface waters.

### Sediment Loss 
Sediment loss of agricultural land occurs due to soil erosion, which generally involves loss of fertile topsoil.  This results in cropland that is less productive.  Sediment runoff is also a leading cause of degraded water quality in rivers, streams, and other waterways.

### SWAT - Soil and Water Assessment Tool
A small watershed to river basin-scale model used to simulate the quality and quantity of surface and ground water and predict the environmental impact of land use, and land management practices.  The version used in the study is QSWAT, an open-source version of SWAT.

### Switchgrass
A native perennial prairie grass with potential for bioenergy production.  
Panicum virgatum

### Watershed
An area of land that drains all the streams and rainfall into a common outlet, such as the outflow of a reservoir, mouth of a bay, or any point along a stream channel.  These are delineated with the soil and water assessment tool (SWAT).

### Willow
A woody shub of genus Sativa that has potential for bioenergy production.
