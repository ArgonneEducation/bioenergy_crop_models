# bioenergy_crop_models
This interactive is intended for use with a case study developed by DOE's Alternative Fuels and Feedstocks Office as part of the Bioenergy Research and Education Bridge Program (BRIDGES).

BRIDGES is a bioenergy case study-based educational toolkit created in partnership with Argonne National Laboratory and Idaho National Laboratory, as well as education, community, industry, and other government partners. You can learn more about the program at https://www.energy.gov/eere/bioenergy/bioenergy-research-and-education-bridge-program .

This interactive app is intended for users of the BETO BRIDGES Case Study in order to simplify the data analysis of watershed model data.  
Users can select whether to compare results for nitrate leaching or sediment.  Values shown are for the individual watersheds delineated by the SWAT model as described in the case study materials.  Users can also select which bioenergy crop to view results for.  This is intended to help with completing Table 6, which requires identification of watersheds for bioenergy crop implementation.  Which ones provide the greatest benefit in terms of reduced nitrate leaching and/or sedimentation?
